##### This project is an introduction to OpenWeatherMap API and Twitter API.  Started by creating universal Interfaceable Chat Bot. Parse the JSON with Java program to make use of data i.e., Current weather and top trends on twitter.  Libraries: GSON, Twitter4J, PircBot.
##### The program identifies the words 'Weather Zipcode(5-digit)', and 'Trends twitter' in user input and gives output accordingly.
